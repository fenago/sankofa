## 1. Study Guide Generator

**What it does:** Creates structured study notes for each skill with key concepts, examples, and practice questions.

**How students use it:**
- Get organized notes for any topic
- Identify what you actually need to know
- Prepare for exams efficiently
- Review material systematically

**The Science Behind It:**

| Research Finding | How the Study Guide Helps |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Organized information is easier to remember** (Cognitive Load Theory - Sweller) | Notes are chunked and structured |
| **You need to know prerequisites first** (Gagné's Learning Hierarchies) | Prerequisites listed before main content |
| **Misconceptions block learning** (Conceptual Change - Posner) | Common mistakes explicitly addressed |
| **Practice questions improve retention** (Testing Effect - Roediger) | Practice questions included |

**What you get:**
- Key concepts and definitions
- "Before you start" prerequisite review
- Examples showing the concept in action
- Practice questions to test yourself
- "Watch out for" common mistakes section

**Pro tip:** Don't just read the study guide—test yourself with the practice questions. Research shows testing yourself is far more effective than re-reading.

## 2. Practice Question Generator

**What it does:** Creates practice questions at the right difficulty level for self-testing.

**How students use it:**
- Test yourself before you feel "ready" (this is when learning happens!)
- Get questions at your level
- Build up to harder questions gradually
- Identify what you still don't understand

**The Science Behind It:**

| Research Finding | How Practice Questions Help |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Testing beats re-reading by 50%+** (Testing Effect - Roediger & Karpicke) | Forces retrieval, not recognition |
| **Difficulty should match ability** (Item Response Theory - Lord) | Questions calibrated to your level |
| **Wrong answers reveal gaps** (Formative Assessment) | Feedback shows what to review |
| **Spaced practice beats cramming** (Spacing Effect - Ebbinghaus) | Practice over multiple sessions |

**What you get:**
- Questions ranging from basic recall to complex application
- Difficulty that matches your current level
- Wrong answer choices based on real misconceptions (not random)
- Explanations for correct answers
- Hints when you're stuck

**Difficulty levels explained:**
| Level | What It Tests | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Easy (b < -1) | Basic recall and understanding | "What is the definition of...?" |
| Medium (b ≈ 0) | Application and analysis | "Given this situation, what would happen if...?" |
| Hard (b > 1) | Evaluation and creation | "Compare these approaches and justify which is better" |

**Pro tip:** If you're getting everything right easily, the questions are too easy. You learn most when you're getting ~70% correct—that's productive struggle.

## 3. Concept Explainer

**What it does:** Explains any concept at different levels—from "explain like I'm 5" to expert detail.

**How students use it:**
- Get a simpler explanation when the textbook doesn't make sense
- See real-world examples and analogies
- Go deeper once you understand the basics
- Connect new concepts to things you already know

**The Science Behind It:**

| Research Finding | How the Explainer Helps |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Multiple representations help** (Dual Coding - Paivio) | Analogies, examples, different angles |
| **New knowledge builds on old** (Schema Theory - Piaget) | Connects to prerequisites you know |
| **Concrete before abstract** (Spiral Curriculum - Bruner) | Simple explanation uses concrete examples |
| **Context helps transfer** (Transfer Research - Perkins & Salomon) | Shows where concept applies in real world |

**What you get:**
- **Simple explanation**: Everyday analogies, no jargon
- **Standard explanation**: Full technical explanation
- **Advanced explanation**: Nuances, edge cases, deeper implications
- **Real-world examples**: Where this applies outside the classroom
- **Connections**: How this relates to what you already know

**Explanation levels:**
| Level | Best For | Example Approach |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Simple | First introduction, confusion | "Think of it like a recipe..." |
| Standard | Main learning | Textbook-style with examples |
| Advanced | Going deeper, exam prep | Technical precision, exceptions |

**Pro tip:** Start simple even if you think you understand. Experts can explain things simply—if you can't, you might not really understand it.

## 4. Misconception Addresser

**What it does:** Shows you common mistakes students make and helps you avoid them.

**How students use it:**
- Find out if you have a wrong understanding
- Avoid mistakes before they become habits
- Understand why the wrong answer seems right
- Correct misunderstandings you didn't know you had

**The Science Behind It:**

| Research Finding | How the Addresser Helps |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Misconceptions persist unless confronted** (Conceptual Change - Posner) | Directly states and corrects wrong ideas |
| **You can "know" right and wrong simultaneously** (Dual Process Theory) | Makes the conflict explicit |
| **Wrong ideas often seem logical** (Intuitive Theories Research) | Explains why the mistake makes sense |
| **Self-testing reveals hidden gaps** (Metacognition Research) | Provides self-check questions |

**What you get:**
- The misconception stated clearly ("Many students think...")
- Why it seems reasonable ("This makes sense because...")
- Why it's wrong ("However, this fails because...")
- The correct understanding ("Instead, what's actually true is...")
- Self-check questions ("You understand this correctly if...")

**Why this matters:** Research shows you can get an A on a test while still holding misconceptions. The wrong ideas don't go away just because you learned correct information—they have to be directly confronted.

**Pro tip:** Read through misconceptions BEFORE studying a topic. This primes your brain to notice when you're falling into a common trap.

## 5. Prerequisite Checker

**What it does:** Tells you exactly what you need to know before learning something new, and tests whether you know it.

**How students use it:**
- Find out if you're ready to learn a new topic
- Identify gaps you didn't know you had
- Get recommendations for what to review
- Stop wasting time on content you're not prepared for

**The Science Behind It:**

| Research Finding | How the Checker Helps |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **50%+ of failures are prerequisite gaps** (Gagné's Hierarchies) | Identifies exactly what's missing |
| **You can't skip foundation** (Mastery Learning - Bloom) | Lists required vs. recommended prerequisites |
| **Gaps increase cognitive load** (CLT - Sweller) | Prevents overload by ensuring readiness |
| **Diagnostic testing improves outcomes** (Formative Assessment) | Quick tests reveal specific gaps |

**What you get:**
- List of prerequisites (required vs. helpful)
- Quick diagnostic questions for each
- Clear verdict: "Ready" or "Review these first"
- Links to review material for gaps
- Time estimate to fill gaps

**Prerequisite types:**
| Type | What It Means | What To Do |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Required** | You MUST know this | Stop and review if missing |
| **Recommended** | Helps a lot | Quick review if rusty |
| **Helpful** | Nice context | Optional—proceed anyway |

**Pro tip:** If you're struggling with new material, the problem is often 2-3 topics back, not the current topic. Go back further than you think.

## 6. Study Guide for Specific Skills

**Note:** This is distinct from the general Study Guide Generator—this creates targeted materials for specific skills you select.

**What it does:** Generates focused study materials for exactly the skills you need to learn.

**How students use it:**
- Target specific weak areas
- Prepare for specific test sections
- Deep dive into particular concepts
- Create custom review sessions

## Learning Science Tips

These tools are built on research. Here are the key findings you should know:

### The Testing Effect
**What it is:** Testing yourself improves memory more than re-reading.
**How to apply:** Use practice questions early and often, even before you feel ready.

### Spaced Practice
**What it is:** Spreading study over time beats cramming.
**How to apply:** Study a little each day rather than all at once before an exam.

### Desirable Difficulty
**What it is:** Harder (but achievable) practice leads to better learning.
**How to apply:** If practice feels too easy, increase the difficulty. Struggling is good.

### Retrieval Practice
**What it is:** Pulling information from memory strengthens it.
**How to apply:** Close your notes and try to recall. Don't just recognize—retrieve.

### Elaboration
**What it is:** Explaining why and how improves understanding.
**How to apply:** Ask yourself "why does this work?" and "how does this connect?"
